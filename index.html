<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> Extraterrestrial life is hypothetical life which may occur outside of Earth and which did not originate on Earth. Such life might range from simple prokaryotes (or comparable life forms) to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. <small>[1][2]</small> The Drake equation speculates about the existence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. The science of extraterrestrial life in all its forms is known as astrobiology.</p>

<p> Since the mid-20th century, active ongoing research has taken place to look for signs of extraterrestrial life. This encompasses a search for current and historic extraterrestrial life, and a narrower search for extraterrestrial intelligent life. Depending on the category of search, methods range from the analysis of telescope and specimen data <small>[3]</small> to radios used to detect and send communication signals.</p>

<p> The concept of extraterrestrial life, and particularly extraterrestrial intelligence, has had a major cultural impact, chiefly in works of science fiction. Over the years, science fiction has introduced a number of theoretical ideas, each having a wide range of possibilities. Many have piqued public interest in the possibilities of extraterrestrial life. One particular concern is the wisdom of attempting communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. Some encourage aggressive methods to make contact with intelligent extraterrestrial life. Others argue to do so may give away the location of Earth, making an invasion possible in the future.<small>[4][5]</small></p>

<h2>General</h2>

<p> Alien life, such as microorganisms, has been hypothesized to exist in the Solar System and throughout the universe. This hypothesis relies on the vast size and consistent physical laws of the observable universe. According to this argument, made by scientists such as Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking,<small>[6]</small> as well as notable personalities such as Winston Churchill,<small>[7][8]</small> it would be improbable for life not to exist somewhere other than Earth.<small>[9][10]</small> This argument is embodied in the Copernican principle, which states that Earth does not occupy a unique position in the Universe, and the mediocrity principle, which states that there is nothing special about life on Earth.<small>[11]</small> The chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when the universe was only 10–17 million years old.<small>[12][13]</small> Life may have emerged independently at many places throughout the universe. Alternatively, life may have formed less frequently, then spread—by meteoroids, for example—between habitable planets in a process called panspermia.<small> [14][15]</small> In any case, complex organic molecules may have formed in the protoplanetary disk of dust grains surrounding the Sun before the formation of Earth.<small>[16]</small> According to these studies, this process may occur outside Earth on several planets and moons of the Solar System and on planets of other stars. <small>[16]</small> </p>

<p> Since the 1950s, astronomers have proposed that "habitable zones" around stars are the most likely places for life to exist. Numerous discoveries of such zones since 2007 have generated numerical estimates of many billions of planets with Earth-like compositions.<small>[17]</small> As of 2013, only a few planets had been discovered in these zones.<small>[18]</small> Nonetheless, on 4 November 2013, astronomers reported, based on Kepler space mission data, that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarfs in the Milky Way,<small>[19][20]</small> 11 billion of which may be orbiting Sun-like stars.<small>[21]</small> The nearest such planet may be 12 light-years away, according to the scientists.<small>[19][20]</small> Astrobiologists have also considered a "follow the energy" view of potential habitats.<small>[22][23]</small></p>

<h2>Evolution</h2>

<p> A study published in 2017 suggests that due to how complexity evolved in species on Earth, the level of predictability for alien evolution elsewhere would make them look similar to life on our planet. One of the study authors, Sam Levin, notes "Like humans, we predict that they are made-up of a hierarchy of entities, which all cooperate to produce an alien. At each level of the organism there will be mechanisms in place to eliminate conflict, maintain cooperation, and keep the organism functioning. We can even offer some examples of what these mechanisms will be."<small>[24]</small> There is also research in assessing the capacity of life for developing intelligence. It has been suggested that this capacity arises with the number of potential niches a planet contains, and that the complexity of life itself is reflected in the information density of planetary environments, which in turn can be computed from its niches.<small>[25]</small></p>

<h2>Biochemical Basis</h2>

<p>Life on Earth requires water as a solvent in which biochemical reactions take place. Sufficient quantities of carbon and other elements, along with water, might enable the formation of living organisms on terrestrial planets with a chemical make-up and temperature range similar to that of Earth.<small>[26][27]</small> Life based on ammonia (rather than water) has been suggested as an alternative, though this solvent appears less suitable than water. It is also conceivable that there are forms of life whose solvent is a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane, ethane or propane.<small>[28]</small></p>

<p>About 29 chemical elements play active roles in living organisms on Earth.<small>[29]</small> About 95% of living matter is built upon only six elements: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur. These six elements form the basic building blocks of virtually all life on Earth, whereas most of the remaining elements are found only in trace amounts.<small>[30]</small> The unique characteristics of carbon make it unlikely that it could be replaced, even on another planet, to generate the biochemistry necessary for life. The carbon atom has the unique ability to make four strong chemical bonds with other atoms, including other carbon atoms. These covalent bonds have a direction in space, so that carbon atoms can form the skeletons of complex 3-dimensional structures with definite architectures such as nucleic acids and proteins. Carbon forms more compounds than all other elements combined. The great versatility of the carbon atom, and its abundance in the visible universe, makes it the element most likely to provide the bases—even exotic ones—for the chemical composition of life on other planets.<small>[31]</small></p>

<h2>Planetary habitability in the Solar System</h2>

<p>Some bodies in the Solar System have the potential for an environment in which extraterrestrial life can exist, particularly those with possible subsurface oceans.<small>[32]</small> Should life be discovered elsewhere in the Solar System, astrobiologists suggest that it will more likely be in the form of extremophile microorganisms. According to NASA's 2015 Astrobiology Strategy, "Life on other worlds is most likely to include microbes, and any complex living system elsewhere is likely to have arisen from and be founded upon microbial life. Important insights on the limits of microbial life can be gleaned from studies of microbes on modern Earth, as well as their ubiquity and ancestral characteristics."<small>[33]</small> Researchers found a stunning array of subterranean organisms, mostly microbial, deep underground and estimate that approximately 70 percent of the total number of Earth's bacteria and archaea organisms live within the Earth's crust.<small>[34]</small> Rick Colwell, a member of the Deep Carbon Observatory team from Oregon State University, told the BBC: "I think it’s probably reasonable to assume that the subsurface of other planets and their moons are habitable, especially since we’ve seen here on Earth that organisms can function far away from sunlight using the energy provided directly from the rocks deep underground".<small>[35]</small></p>

<p>Mars may have niche subsurface environments where microbial life might exist.<small>[36][37][38]</small> A subsurface marine environment on Jupiter's moon Europa might be the most likely habitat in the Solar System, outside Earth, for extremophile microorganisms.<small>[39][40][41]</small></p>

<p>The panspermia hypothesis proposes that life elsewhere in the Solar System may have a common origin. If extraterrestrial life was found on another body in the Solar System, it could have originated from Earth just as life on Earth could have been seeded from elsewhere (exogenesis).<small>[42]</small> The first known mention of the term 'panspermia' was in the writings of the 5th century BC Greek philosopher Anaxagoras.<small>[43]</small> In the 19th century it was again revived in modern form by several scientists, including Jöns Jacob Berzelius (1834),<small>[44]</small> Kelvin (1871),<small>[45]</small> Hermann von Helmholtz (1879)<small>[46]</small> and, somewhat later, by Svante Arrhenius (1903).<small>[47]</small> Sir Fred Hoyle (1915–2001) and Chandra Wickramasinghe (born 1939) are important proponents of the hypothesis who further contended that life forms continue to enter Earth's atmosphere, and may be responsible for epidemic outbreaks, new diseases, and the genetic novelty necessary for macroevolution.<small>[48]</small></p>

<p>Directed panspermia concerns the deliberate transport of microorganisms in space, sent to Earth to start life here, or sent from Earth to seed new stellar systems with life. The Nobel prize winner Francis Crick, along with Leslie Orgel proposed that seeds of life may have been purposely spread by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization,<small>[49]</small> but considering an early "RNA world" Crick noted later that life may have originated on Earth.<small>[50]</small></p>

<strong>Mercury</strong>

<p>There may be scientific support, based on studies reported in March 2020, for considering that parts of the planet Mercury may have been habitable, and perhaps that life forms, albeit likely primitive microorganisms, may have existed on the planet.<small>[51][52]</small></p>

<strong>Venus</strong>

<p>In the early 20th century, Venus was considered to be similar to Earth for habitability, but observations since the beginning of the Space Age revealed that the Venus surface temperature is around 872 °F (467 °C), making it inhospitable for Earth-life.<small>[53]</small> Likewise, the atmosphere of Venus is almost completely carbon dioxide, which can be toxic to Earth-like life. Between the altitudes of 50 and 65 kilometers, the pressure and temperature are Earth-like, and it may accommodate thermoacidophilic extremophile microorganisms in the acidic upper layers of the Venusian atmosphere.<small>[54][55][56][57]</small> Furthermore, Venus likely had liquid water on its surface for at least a few million years after its formation.<small>[58][59][60]</small></p>

<strong>Mars</strong>

<p>Life on Mars has been long speculated. Liquid water is widely thought to have existed on Mars in the past, and now can occasionally be found as low-volume liquid brines in shallow Martian soil.<small>[61]</small> The origin of the potential biosignature of methane observed in Mars' atmosphere is unexplained, although hypotheses not involving life have also been proposed.<small>[62]</small></p>

<p>There is evidence that Mars had a warmer and wetter past: dried-up river beds, polar ice caps, volcanoes, and minerals that form in the presence of water have all been found. Nevertheless, present conditions on Mars' subsurface may support life.<small>[63][64]</small> Evidence obtained by the Curiosity rover studying Aeolis Palus, Gale Crater in 2013 strongly suggests an ancient freshwater lake that could have been a hospitable environment for microbial life.<small>[65][66]</small></p>

<p>Current studies on Mars by the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers are searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic and/or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable.<small>[67][68][69][70]</small> The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on Mars is now a primary NASA objective.[67]</p>

<strong>Ceres</strong>

<p>Ceres, the only dwarf planet in the asteroid belt, has a thin water-vapor atmosphere.<small>[71][72]</small>The vapor could have been produced by ice volcanoes or by ice near the surface sublimating (transforming from solid to gas).<small>[73]</small> Nevertheless, the presence of water on Ceres had led to speculation that life may be possible there.<small>[74][75][76]</small> It is one of the few places in our solar system where scientists would like to search for possible signs of life.<small>[77]</small> Hence, it is a possibility that the planet could support life to very small microbes similar to bacteria. Although the planet might not have living things today, there could be signs it harbored life in the past.<small>[78]</small></p>

<strong>Jupiter</strong>

<p>Carl Sagan and others in the 1960s and 1970s computed conditions for hypothetical microorganisms living in the atmosphere of Jupiter.<small>[79]</small> The intense radiation and other conditions, however, do not appear to permit encapsulation and molecular biochemistry, so life there is thought unlikely.<small>[80]</small> In contrast, some of Jupiter's moons may have habitats capable of sustaining life. Scientists have indications that heated subsurface oceans of liquid water may exist deep under the crusts of the three outer Galilean moons—Europa,<small>[39][40][81]</small> Ganymede,<small>[82][83][84][85]</small> and Callisto.<small>[86][87][88]</small> The EJSM/Laplace mission is planned to determine the habitability of these environments.</p>

<strong>Europa</strong>

<p>Internal structure of Europa. The blue is a subsurface ocean. Such subsurface oceans could possibly harbor life.<small>[89]</small> Jupiter's moon Europa has been subject to speculation about the existence of life due to the strong possibility of a liquid water ocean beneath its ice surface.<small>[39][41]</small> Hydrothermal vents on the bottom of the ocean, if they exist, may warm the water and could be capable of supporting nutrients and energy to microorganisms.<small>[90]</small> It is also possible that Europa could support aerobic macrofauna using oxygen created by cosmic rays impacting its surface ice.<small>[91]</small></p>

<p>The case for life on Europa was greatly enhanced in 2011 when it was discovered that vast lakes exist within Europa's thick, icy shell. Scientists found that ice shelves surrounding the lakes appear to be collapsing into them, thereby providing a mechanism through which life-forming chemicals created in sunlit areas on Europa's surface could be transferred to its interior.<small>[92][93]</small></p>

<p>On 11 December 2013, NASA reported the detection of "clay-like minerals" (specifically, phyllosilicates), often associated with organic materials, on the icy crust of Europa.<small>[94]</small> The presence of the minerals may have been the result of a collision with an asteroid or comet according to the scientists.<small>[94]</small> The Europa Clipper, which would assess the habitability of Europa, is planned for launch in 2025.<small>[95][96]</small> Europa's subsurface ocean is considered the best target for the discovery of life.<small>[39][41]</small></p>

<strong>Saturn system</strong>

<p>Like Jupiter, Saturn is not likely to host life. However, Titan and Enceladus have been speculated to have possible habitats supportive of life.<small>[62][97][98][99]</small></p>

<strong>Enceladus</strong>

<p>Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, has some of the conditions for life, including geothermal activity and water vapor, as well as possible under-ice oceans heated by tidal effects.<small>[100][101]</small> The Cassini–Huygens probe detected carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen—all key elements for supporting life—during its 2005 flyby through one of Enceladus's geysers spewing ice and gas. The temperature and density of the plumes indicate a warmer, watery source beneath the surface.<small>[62]</small></p>

<strong>Titan</strong>

<p>Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, is the only known moon in the Solar System with a significant atmosphere. Data from the Cassini–Huygens mission refuted the hypothesis of a global hydrocarbon ocean, but later demonstrated the existence of liquid hydrocarbon lakes in the polar regions—the first stable bodies of surface liquid discovered outside Earth.<small>[97][98][99]</small> Analysis of data from the mission has uncovered aspects of atmospheric chemistry near the surface that are consistent with—but do not prove—the hypothesis that organisms there if present, could be consuming hydrogen, acetylene and ethane, and producing methane.<small>[102][103][104]</small></p>

<strong>Small Solar System bodies</strong>

<p>Small Solar System bodies have also been speculated to host habitats for extremophiles. Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe have proposed that microbial life might exist on comets and asteroids.<small>[105][106][107][108]</small></p>

<strong>Other bodies</strong>

<p>Models of heat retention and heating via radioactive decay in smaller icy Solar System bodies suggest that Rhea, Titania, Oberon, Triton, Pluto, Eris, Sedna, and Orcus may have oceans underneath solid icy crusts approximately 100 km thick.<small>[109]</small> Of particular interest in these cases is the fact that the models indicate that the liquid layers are in direct contact with the rocky core, which allows efficient mixing of minerals and salts into the water. This is in contrast with the oceans that may be inside larger icy satellites like Ganymede, Callisto, or Titan, where layers of high-pressure phases of ice are thought to underlie the liquid water layer.<small>[109]</small></p>

<p>Hydrogen sulfide has been proposed as a hypothetical solvent for life and is quite plentiful on Jupiter's moon Io, and may be in liquid form a short distance below the surface.<small>[110]</small></p>
